Ouptnew folder contains
=================

1- Output for comparison between spatial ( high - low - negtive) for each animal with and withour outlier removed

- For each comparison, I provide the total number of observations (without missing observations) and then the total number of observations actually used in the test, after removing outliers (dif_X_Y)

- The remaining on the columns in each output data file are self explanatory

- Output file ending in -no-outl are files for which we removed outliers

- For the treatment group comparaisons, I did not perform the comparaison without outliers --  


2- Comparison between treatment groups across animals
   where observatins from the same animal are averaged

3- Comparison between the groups who received the AOM and the groups that did not. I did not consider the case with outlier removal

4- In the output with outlier removal, there two columns of that counts the number of X and Y observations. The columns with low counts represents the number of observations left after we remove outliers
